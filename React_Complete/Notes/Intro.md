# Intro

## What is React?

- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- It is a JS Library hence requires a JS compiler called Node js to run these react componenets.
- It uses JS to build UI components.
- React offers a simple Mental model for development.

## Vite template

- npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed

- `npx create-vite@latest . -- --template react-ts`

## A historical Glimpse

- In server side rendering the website is rendred in the backend and then sent to the client.
- The browser then takes this rendered code and displays to the user.
- Hence JS was mainly ised to add simple and core functionality.
- JQuery was more popular.
- Then came single page applications, they are rendered in the client side. Hence client does the heavy loading.
- The frontend only demands of data from the basckend.
- It is difficult to manage large data using Vanilla JS only.
- In Vanilla JS, the data is stored in the DOM. Hence it is difficult to manage large data as it will be shared between more and more components.
- As keeping the UI and Data in sync is difficult, React made it less complex.
